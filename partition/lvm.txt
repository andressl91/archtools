### GUIDE FOR CREATING LVM VOLUMES #####

1. FIRST MAKE PHYSICAL VOLUMES
    - list all devices capable of being used as a physical volume (optional)
        run: lvmdiskscan
        or : lvs to list all current Logical Volumes with their VG
        or : vgs to list all current Volume Groups with their VG
        or : pvs to list all current Physical Volume with their VG

pvcreate /dev/sda  
## OR if partitioned## 
pvcreate /dev/sda1
        - Can now display physical volumes with: pvdisplay

2. MAKE A VOLUME GROUP TO THE PHYSCIAL VOLUME
vgcreate <volume group> <path/to/physical volume>

# IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PHYSICAL VOLUMES YOU WANT TO HAVE FOR ONE VOLUME GROUP
vgextend <volumne group> <physical volume>
    - To track how your volume group grows: vgdisplay

3. NOW CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME ATTACHED TO THE VOLUME GROUP
lvcreate -L <size> <volume group> -n <logical volume>
- BONUS: IF YOU WANT TO ALLOCATE ALL REMAINING SPACE: lvcreate -l 100%FREE <volume group> -n <logical volume>

#### NOTES ####
The logical colume is now mapped to /dev/<volume_name>/<logical volume>

4. CREATE FILE SYSTEM AND MOUNT LOGICAL VOLUMES
mkfs.<ftype> /dev/<volume group>/<logical volume>
mount /dev/<volume group>/<logical volume> /<mountpoint>

DONE!


###### REMOVAL OF LVM VOLUMES AND GROUPS
1. LOCATE LOGICAL VOLUMES AND THEIR MOUNTPOINTS. 
- List all logical volumes with: lvs
- List all mountpoints of these logical volumes

2. UNMOUNT MOUNTPOINTS OF LOGICAL VOLUMES
umount /<mountpoint>

3. REMOVE LOGICAL VOLUME
lvremove <volume group>/<logical volume>

4. REMOVE VOLUME GROUP (make sure no volumes are present i volume group)
    - NICE TOOL, USE: vgs, to see virtual groups and their attaced nr of logical volues.
                 ALSO: pvscan, easier to se what physical storage is used for a VG

- DEACTIVATE THE VOLUME GROUP: vgchange -a n <volume group>
                                -a is holder for activate, takes y/n for activate/deactivate
- REMOVE THE VOLUME GROUP: vgremove <volume group>
