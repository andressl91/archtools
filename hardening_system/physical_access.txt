 after root=/dev... ro, add "systemd.unit=rescue.target", or simply "rescue".
# Can set simply "s" after ro, on other systems not using systemd 

# Navigate to /lib/systemd/system
# Make sure both rescue.service and emergency.service DO NOT initiate 
# sushell. If sushell is set, booter get imidiate loginshell without putting in root pass.
