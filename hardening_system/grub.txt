# Steps mentioned in physcial_access.txt can be bypassed again in boot config
for grup, by simply setting init=/bin/bash, skipping systemd/init

In boot-configuration by the "linux line" (communicating with kernel), add at the end
- init=/bin/bash   / we are telling the kernel to use /bin/bash as the init-system, we
                   / we are dropped in a root shell  

# To avoid this, we set a password so the boot configuration cant be edited without
knowing the password. we are protecting the grub boot-loader.


# EDIT 40_custom file!  
- 40_custom is not touched in case of package update!  

# To secure grub, we have to edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and set 
set superusers="root"   / Here users can be anythong
password root root      / Set password for user set, chose something better


# weakness with this is that pasword is in plain view, instead run
grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2  \ you will be prompted with to enter password twice
                      \ long string will we produced
                      \ Take the part from  grub.pbkdf2.sha512.......... all the way to the end

set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.biglongstring


IMPORTANT RECONFIGURE grub.cfg, binary might be OS dependent
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# YOU CAN VISUALLY CHECK CHANGES IN grub.cfg, search for superuser
