# Encryption using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)

# Preparation
- It's recommended to perform a secure erase of the disk by overwriting
  the entire drive with random data.
  - NOTE! When wiping large amount of data, the process will take several hours 
    to several days to complete.

  Example using dd: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx
          using shred: sudo shred /dev/sdx -n1 -f -z
          -z Add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
          -n1 Overwrite N times instead of default (3)
          -f change persmissions to allow writing if necessary

# You need cryptsetup (pacman -S cryptsetup, or OS equivalent)

# We assume here a removable media, but any disk/drive is equavalent
1. Format drive or removable media if needed

2. cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 (or whatever partition )
 - Type YES
 - Set password  
 - It is now encryptet with luks

# Make a logical device-mapper "foo", for luks partion
3. cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 foo
 - Enter password
 - will show as /dev/mapper/foo


 Optional, run cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda1 to very success.

# Only first time... we need to make a filesystem. As usual, be unmounted
4. mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/foo

# Make mountpoint if nescecarry, and mount dev/mapper/foo
5. mount /dev/mapper/foo /mnt

# We have now encrypted partition, and mounted it

# To remove
- umount /mnt
- cryptsetup luksClose foo (will remove from /dev/mapper/foo)
