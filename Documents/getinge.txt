Another of our focus areas this year is Flushers.
A total of 7 Flushers where bought by Getinge in 2018, however as we believed that the market potential was higher,
we initiated discussions with Getinge regarding aquaring the LTC business.

The discussions/negotiations resultee in Arjo taking over the LTC business from Getinge as of January 1.1.2019.
Getinge will continue as an AC distributor, but Arjo will be their primary supplier.

The previous agreement, allows both Getinge and Arjo to focus on Flushers in the different segments.

Our current sales strategy regarding installation products has undergone a restructure, allowing our field technicians to  
sell Flushers. Therefore, the first quarter the technicians have strengthen their competance of tha product operation and maintainance/service.

The initial results of the new strategy has shown good results, as Arjo has recieved a total of 37 orders for Flushers just in the first 4 months.
This result confirm our initial belief of a higher market potential. With the ability to use our market awareness and adapt to the current marked situation,
we have shown to  enforce our potential withing Flushers and gain market shares.
