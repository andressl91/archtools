# MANUAL FOR SETTING VARIABLES TO POINT TO CROSS COMPILER 

Option 1:

You can set CMake variables at command line like this:

cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/path/to/your/c/compiler/executable" -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/path/to/your/cpp/compiler/executable" /path/to/directory/containing/CMakeLists.txt

See this to learn how to create a CMake cache entry.

Option 2:

In your shell script build_ios.sh you can set environment variables CC and CXX to point to your C and C++ compiler executable respectively, example:

export CC=/path/to/your/c/compiler/executable
export CXX=/path/to/your/cpp/compiler/executable
cmake /path/to/directory/containing/CMakeLists.txt

Option 3:

Edit the CMakeLists.txt file of "Assimp": Add these lines at the top (must be added before you use project() or enable_language() command)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "/path/to/your/c/compiler/executable")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/path/to/your/cpp/compiler/executable")

See this to learn how to use set command in CMake. Also this is a useful resource for understanding use of some of the common CMake variables.
